### Gridded Time-Series manipulation and analysis

Management of gridded time-series (arrays with a time dimension),
    normally geographical (longitude, latitude, depth/altitude). The package provides
    methods to read and write gridded time-series (GTS) objects and manage them using
    R time-series methods. 
    
  See <https://roliveros-ramos.github.io/gts/> for more details.

### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get gts is to install it from CRAN:
 #install.packages("gts")

# Alternatively, install the stable development version from OSMOSE drat repository:
install.packages("gts", repo="https://osmose-model.github.io/drat/")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("roliveros-ramos/gts")
```

### Usage

For a quick introduction, check the worked the examples available from the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(gts)
vignette("gts")
```

For a more detailed explanation of the package philosophy, you can read the article [gts: an R package for fitting complex ecological models][publication].
